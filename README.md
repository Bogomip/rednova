StellarNova is a web based MMO space trading game, based upon the a 2002 game <a href="https://blacknova.net/">Black Nova Traders</a> by Ron Harwood. It is a modern recreation which improves significantly upon UI making for a more fluid gameplay, and rebalances the game to enable different play modes for users.

## Tech Usage

StellarNova is a Express, MySQL, Angular and Node creation. It has a custom backend (<a href="https://github.com/Bogomip/rednova-backend">repo</a>) and frontend (current repo).

The use of Angular here was important. The main point to remake this was to reduce clicks and make the game smoother to perform quick actions, thus a single page app was a perfect fit for it. The node/express backend has a pooled connection to the mysql database to create a fast and efficient database connection and keep the frontend moving as fast as possible for the player.
